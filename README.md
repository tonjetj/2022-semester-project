## Getting Started

### Installing

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone [git@github.com:NoroffFEU/portfolio-1-example.git](https://github.com/tonjetj/2022-semester-project.git)
```

2. Install the dependencies:

To install the necessary dependencies for your GitHub repository project after cloning, follow these steps:

 a. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the official Node.js website.

 b. Open your project in an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or any text editor of your choice.

 c. Install the dependencies listed in the package.json file by running:
 
```
npm install 
```

This will install the necessary dependencies, including SASS, Bootstrap, and any other dependencies specified in the package.json file.

**Note:** If you encounter any issues during the installation process, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

3. Additional Dependencies:

In addition to the dependencies managed by npm, make sure you have the following software installed and set up:

- SASS: Install SASS globally by running the following command:

  ```
  npm install -g sass

This will enable you to compile SASS files into CSS.

- Live Server: Install Live Server globally by running the following command:

This will allow you to run a local development server for testing and previewing your project.

Make sure these dependencies are installed and configured properly before proceeding to run the project.
